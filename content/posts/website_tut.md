## TECH STACK

- Static site generator: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Hosting: [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- Version control: [Git + GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Theme: [Hugo-Narrow](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-narrow/)

If you only want the quickest setup: Hugo + GitHub Pages is the shortest path I found.
